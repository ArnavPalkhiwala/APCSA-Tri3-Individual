# AP STUDY PLAN

* Something that will be crucial for me to do well on AP exams is participating well on the assignments assigned to us in class and focusing on understanding as much about Java code as it is possible for me because it will all come in handy later when I do take the exam 
* Also, I will begin to review each of the progress check multiple-choice (MC) that we did in first trimester because they did a great job of testing us on relevant content that will be on the AP exam in the future 
* I have my journal also with a focus on the questions that I missed, so being able to check over that and do some revisions to make sure I do not get the same questions wrong multiple times
* I can also look online on YouTube and CollegeBoard because they both have great videos with content that can clarify any questions I have on content that I did not understand in class and through the practice exercises I did
* Lastly, I will review all of the frqs we did last trimester and redo them so I can make sure I retained all of the knowledge I learned last trimester -> this will not only help me practice for the type of questions on the AP EXAM but also reinforce content I am not confident in

| Week 1 (day)      | Task/Work | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Monday      | Today I will begin studying from the 5 Steps to 5 Book and do a good review of units 1-4 to address any points of confusion. I will then take one of their practice multiple choice questions and review my responses to ensure that I am doing everything correctly and understand all of thsoe topics.       | 
| Tuesday  | I will take the 2014 MC practice test -> after taking it: I feel confident considering I received a 36/39 on the exam and still finished with a few minutes. There would be around 30 more minutes provided on the AP Exam so I feel comfortable  doing everyhting in time.      |
| Wednesday       | This will be my final review day and later on I will only focus on practicing and applying knowledge. I will review units 5-10 and specifically focus my time on inheritance because that seems to be the most difficult area of concern on the exam. I will use my book provided in order to practice and prepare for the harder concepts.     |
| Thursday | I will do the FRQ and do my best to finish it in time. I understand and know that I will have 30 more minutes provided on the AP Exam itself but being prepared and having enough time will be perfect I will plenty of time to review my work and check all my answers as needed.    |
| Friday   |I will review my mistakes on the FRQ and start another MC. I realize that the only way I can be prepared is if I do as much practice as possible, so that is exactly what I will do. |

**I will follow these steps each week and do it with my team members so we can hold each other accountable for if we skip a day.**

Only the second time will the updated and new array be printed which makes sense now.|
