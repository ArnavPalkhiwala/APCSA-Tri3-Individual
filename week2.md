# Calculator Highlights

* Something that was key for me was understanding Reverse Polish Notation and how to integrate it with my ideas in order to create a well-functioning project
* I had to do a lot of research on the Shunting Yard Algorithm but in the end, it seems to help a lot and is very useful: <img width="1259" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-27 at 9 49 52 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25650329/160328503-13ac270e-c0ae-4ed4-847c-cadfe4709452.png">
* Creating this project is something cool because you do not need to have separate buttons for the type of operation you are going to do; rather, the program is able to figure everything out frmo what you type in

* Using this code was ery useful because it set me up for success with reverse polish notation and using it in this area 
* Having a driver was something really useful for testing out the algorithm and ensuring that it works exactly as expected and it can understand the type of operation that it needs to complete

* Splitting it into operator and number array and doing the sorting this way was extremly helpful and did a great job of simplifying this process for me personally

* These are all ideas that I targeted and implementing them in my project were key for me; it was good motivation and set me up for success
