# Sorting Implementations

Insertion:
* For the insertion, I used a for loop in conjunction with a while loop<img width="331" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-04 at 8 23 17 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25650329/161577337-e0284c15-62ed-4d9e-90fc-401f9b8b63b8.png">

*  It is essentially like a for loop with the while loop condition of a temp variable that is decreasing in value each time 
*  Also, there is a comparison value that is increasing and a swaps value also that keeps track of this data
*  Time is also made with the duration feature

Merge:
*  This is definitely the haredest sort method because of the implementation of recursionand its use in the program <img width="321" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-04 at 8 20 29 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25650329/161576730-1bcdce76-9408-4684-8d29-ee12c2757158.png">

*  This had a second method for the other part of merging which was hard to create<img width="500" alt="Screen Shot 2022-04-04 at 8 20 09 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25650329/161576653-1683915b-8587-4b44-98bd-535b9e78102e.png">

*  Also, there is a comparison value that is increasing and a swaps value also that keeps track of this data
*  Time is also made with the duration feature

Bubble:
