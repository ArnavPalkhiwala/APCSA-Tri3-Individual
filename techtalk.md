# Tech Talk Notes
This contains my individual notes and plans for each tech talk we have this trimester. It is nicely organized and easy to read and understand.

# [Tech Talk 0 - Data Structures](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/nighthawk_csa/wiki/Tri-3:-Tech-Talk-0---Data-Structures)
Important Notes and Takeaways:
* Data structures are used to organize data which are more sequences or tables of values rather than a single value
* An example of this is a list of numbers 
* There are different types of data structures which are primitive and non-primitive
* Primitive data structures are Integer, Floats, Strings, Booleans
* Non-Primitive are Arrays, Lists (different types: linear, non-linear, stacks, graphs, queues, trees), Tuple, Dictionary, Set, File
* Algorithms interact with data structures to create optimized code
* Imperative programming uses statements to change a program's states
* Objected Oriented Programming uses classes and objects to create objects and instances of them -> constructors, encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism
* Common Data Structures are Arrays/Lists, Dictionaries/Hashmaps 
* Hashmap Example: <img width="613" alt="Screen Shot 2022-03-13 at 9 41 05 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25650329/158106065-8eb3d100-8c95-4dbc-a694-01d4894e490b.png">
* Algorithms always accompany data structures

Plans: Incorporate Challenges in Project and Correctly Implement them
1. Create an alternative menu in Java with a data structure and try and catch which is dynamic, rather than simply having switch statements that are hardcoded. This will likely use abstraction because subclasses are needed.
2. Create a java class that can swap two numbers based on value. It prints the numbers first in the order given, then switches them and organizes them by value -> prints this out.
3. Use 2D arrays in Jaca to print a formatted matrix; this has a toString method to format and output a String and properly accessing values in the 2D Array
