Describe Linked Lists:
* Linked lists are data structures with objects of the same type
* This is quite similar to an array list, though there are differences in terms of syntax, methods -- their use cases are very similar as well
* An example is -> LinkedList<String> cars = new LinkedList<String>();
* .size() demonstrates the number of elements in a linked list
* Elements can be added and removed exactly like array lists 
  
Describe Java Generic T
* Generic T is a data type parameter that refeences Java's geeric class (parameterized over types)
* Since it is an Object, anything can be passed in instead like Integer, String
* This is very flexible and easy to use as a result
