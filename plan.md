| Week 1 (day)      | Task/Work | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Monday      | Today I will begin studying from the 5 Steps to 5 Book and do a good review of units 1-4 to address any points of confusion. I will then take one of their practice multiple choice questions and review my responses to ensure that I am doing everything correctly and understand all of thsoe topics.       | 
| Tuesday  | I will take the 2014 MC practice test -> after taking it: I feel confident considering I received a 36/39 on the exam and still finished with a few minutes. There would be around 30 more minutes provided on the AP Exam so I feel comfortable  doing everyhting in time.      |
| Wednesday       | This will be my final review day and later on I will only focus on practicing and applying knowledge. I will review units 5-10 and specifically focus my time on inheritance because that seems to be the most difficult area of concern on the exam. I will use my book provided in order to practice and prepare for the harder concepts.     |
| Thursday | I will do the FRQ and do my best to finish it in time. I understand and know that I will have 30 more minutes provided on the AP Exam itself but being prepared and having enough time will be perfect I will plenty of time to review my work and check all my answers as needed.    |
| Friday   |I will review my mistakes on the FRQ and start another MC. I realize that the only way I can be prepared is if I do as much practice as possible, so that is exactly what I will do. |

10.1 Recursion:
A recursive method calls itself (in the method)
Recursive methods have at least one base case to stop the recursion and at least one recursive call
Each recursive call has its own set of local variables
Parameters show the progress of a recursive process similar to loop control i in a for loop
A recursive solution can be replicated with loops such as for/while
Writing recursive program code not in CB for CSA
Recursion can be used to traverse String, array, and ArrayList objects

9.1 Creating Superclasses and Subclasses:
A class hierarchy can be developed by putting common attributes and behaviors of related classes into a one class called a superclass
Subclasses that extend a superclass and use attributes and behaviors of the superclass without being in this class’ code
“is-a” relationship 
The keyword extends is used to establish a inheritance between a subclass and a superclass and one subclass can extend only one superclass

8.1 2D Arrays:
2D arrays are basically arrays of arrays so they can be made and indexed just like 1D arrays
For AP CSA, when accessing the element at arr[first][second], the first index is used for rows, the second index is used for columns (key point to know)
There are non rectangular 2D arrays just not in this course
The initializer list used to create and initialize a 2D array which is made up of initializer lists that are 1D arrays
The square brackets are used to access and modify an element in a 2D array           [element row][element col]
“Row-major order” means an ordering of 2D array elements where traversal goes through and across each row, while “column-major order” traversal is down each column

7.1 Introduction to ArrayList:
An ArrayList is mutable and contains object references
ArrayList() makes an empty list with no values set
There is a generic type ArrayList and the generic type E includes elements’ types
When ArrayList is specified, the types of the reference parameters and return type when using the methods are type
ArrayList is preferred over ArrayList because it allows the compiler to find errors that would otherwise be found at run-time 

6.1 Array Creation and Access:
Array allows for multiple related items in one variable
Size is created when array is made and CANNOT be changed
Arrays store primitive or object reference data
Array made with keyword new and all element initialized with specific value: ints to 0, double to 0.0, boolean to false, and reference type are initialized to null
[] square brackets are used to access/modify elements in an array (1D array)
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when index of array is trying to be accessed but that index does not exist in the array; valid index values for an array are 0 to length of array - 1

5.1 Anatomy of a Class:
The keywords public and private affect the access of classes, data, constructors, and methods and private does not allow them to be accessed outside the class while public does
Access to attributes should be kept internal to the class so instance variables are private and constructors are public
Multiple objects can be made of a signal class and methods can be private or public 
Create objects using the keyword new

4.1 While Loops:
Iteration statements repeat a set of statements for a specific amount of time 
Boolean expressions are evaluated before each iteration of the loop and if it is true, the loop body is executed
It stops when it is false 
A loop is an infinite loop when the Boolean expression always evaluates to true
If the Boolean expression evaluates to false initially, the loop body is not executed at all
Executing a return statement inside an iteration statement end the method and stop
Use % to determine the remainder
Can find the minimum or maximum value and compute a sum, average, or mode

If-Else Statements
If statements contain a condition and if the conditions are met and are true, then a certain part of code (inside the if statement) is executed
If the conditions for an if statement is not met, the code inside of it does not run, but if there is an else, that code will run
Example: In this example, the if statement checks age and if the age is greater than 16, it says you can learn to drive   else, you are not old enough
